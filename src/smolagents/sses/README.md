# Smolagents Self-Evolving System (SSES)

## Overview
The Smolagents Self-Evolving System (SSES) extends the existing Smolagents framework using a tool composition approach to enable agent evolution through prompt specialization, confidence assessment, and index-based evaluation. By implementing functionality as tools rather than through inheritance, SSES provides modular capabilities while preserving compatibility with the core framework.

## Core Philosophy
1. **Extend, Don't Replace**: Build on existing Smolagents patterns
2. **Composition Over Inheritance**: Implement features as tools rather than through complex inheritance
3. **Layered Adoption**: Enable incremental complexity adoption
4. **Version Control Integration**: Leverage git for tracking evolution
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with minimal viable tools and enhance iteratively

## Layers

### Core Layer
Essential tools with minimal overhead:
- ThinkTool: Integration point for reasoning and evolution
- ConfidenceAssessorTool: Evaluates agent confidence for tasks

### Evolution Layer
Versioning and specialization mechanisms:
- PromptVersioningTool: Manages prompt versioning with git
- EvaluationTool: Comprehensive evaluation framework
- KnowledgeRepositoryTool: Extracts and validates patterns

### Advanced Layer
Sophisticated discovery and optimization:
- SpecializationTool: Creates domain-specific agents
- DomainDiscoveryTool: Identifies domains through clustering
- TaskRouterTool: Routes tasks to specialized agents

## Getting Started
Detailed documentation and examples coming soon.
